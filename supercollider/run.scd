/* GUI functions

The four buttons along the top of the window show the status of the four motor
controllers. Each button has four possible states indicating:
    - blank: offline or unplugged
    - green: ready
    - blue: not ready (performing an action)
    - red: alarm (driver error)

The bar number box indicates the current bar which increments during play. Click
in the box to type a bar number to start at, then press enter or tab.

The test button plays a sequence of full turns on each motor in order.

The play button starts playback.

Closing the window will shutdown all playback and close connections to the motor
controllers. */
